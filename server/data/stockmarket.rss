Last month, I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/l5ygd8/dd_on_thcbmicrovast_the_stars_appear_to_be/&quot;&gt;DD on $THCB&lt;/a&gt; three days before their Definitive Agreement to merge with Microvast sent the shareprice flying from $15 to $24. I&amp;#39;m back again today to share some of my research and speculations of Microvast and reasons why I&amp;#39;m expecting this to be a multi-bagger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. BlackRock:&lt;/strong&gt; as part of the merger, Microvast received $540m in PIPE investments, most of which came from BlackRock. In case you don&amp;#39;t know who BlackRock is, they are the king of all investment funds with $8+ Trillion of assets under management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now there are lots of companies of which BlackRock has a sizable ownership% owing to the fact that these companies are part of one index or another. For example, if BlackRock has $10 billion invested in the Russell 2000 Index, and XYZ Corp accounts for 0.1% of the index, then BlackRock &amp;quot;owns&amp;quot; $10 million of XYZ corp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the case with Microvast. BlackRock thoroughly vetted the company and invested a huge sum in the company in the form of a PIPE. For a lot of people, this is enough evidence that Microvast is a solid investment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. OshKosh:&lt;/strong&gt; customer and strategic partner. And I want to emphasize the &lt;em&gt;customer&lt;/em&gt; part. Part of the $540m PIPE came from OshKosh ($OSK), an American industrial company that builds trucks and military vehicles. They are currently working with Ford on a Next-gen Delivery Vehicle bid for a $6.5 billion contract with USPS who many are assuming is going to Workhorse $WKHS because Joe Biden mandated that the federal fleet will be replaced with American-made EVs, and Workhorse is the only contractor with a proposal that fits the bill (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, OshKosh fully intends to stay in the bidding process, and they will update their NGDV proposal (currently a diesel model) with an electric model. How do I know OskKosh is still shooting for that USPS contract? Well, because their own CEO said so: &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve got a very strong, very comprehensive bid that meets all of the needs of the U.S. postal service. So I mean, repeat that we do meet all the needs of the U.S. postal service, meaning if they want under the Biden administration, more weight towards one type of propulsion than another. We&amp;#39;re ready for that. Now we&amp;#39;ve got our fingers crossed. We believe, we&amp;#39;ve got high reliability solutions and hope to have good news at the next earnings call.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, so a OshKosh/Ford joint venture is bidding for a USPS contract. What does that have to do with THCB? Microvast sells batteries for commercial vehicles and OshKosh happens to be a &lt;em&gt;customer&lt;/em&gt;, remember? But that&amp;#39;s not all:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Ford:&lt;/strong&gt; USCAR (a collaboration between Ford, GM, and FCA) awarded a $1 million contract to assess Microvast&amp;#39;s Lithium-Ion batteries. This a doubly big deal because OshKosh/Ford&amp;#39;s NGDV will need a battery, and Ford&amp;#39;s battery supplier for their EV trucks is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. SK Innovation,&lt;/strong&gt; whose EV battery business (importation, domestic production, and sale of batteries for electric vehicles) will be banned in the U.S. for 10 years by the ITC. This means that Ford will be looking for a new EV battery supplier before SK Innovation&amp;#39;s grace period to operate in the U.S. is up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. M Stanley Whittingham,&lt;/strong&gt; 2019 Nobel laureate and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Stanley_Whittingham&quot;&gt;Founding Father of Lithium-Ion batteries&lt;/a&gt; is joining Microvast&amp;#39;s board of directors. I&amp;#39;m not shitting you. This would be like Boeing having the Wright brothers on their board of directors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;The &amp;quot;Chinese&amp;quot; stigma&lt;/strong&gt;: Microvast is often regarded as a &amp;quot;Chinese&amp;quot; company and there is a bit of investor apprehension reflected in its current share price owing to that fact. Although Microvast is headquartered in Texas, the majority of Microvast&amp;#39;s current operations is in fact in Huzhou, China. This isn&amp;#39;t because Microvast is a Chinese company, however, but because most of Microvast&amp;#39;s customers are in China. This will become a thing of the past once Microvast&amp;#39;s plants in Germany and Tennessee begin production (more on that later)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. The USPS Angle:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s highly unlikely to me that Workhorse will win a significant portion of the $6.3b contract. My money is on OshKosh/Ford winning the contract for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Workhorse was already rejected once by USPS in 2016 during the earlier phase of the bid&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Workhorse snuck their way back into the bidding process by partnering up with VT Hackney&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The VT Hackney-Workhorse&amp;#39;s prototype reportedly injured the USPS employee who was testing it when its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benzinga.com/news/20/10/17838749/workhorse-short-seller-says-usps-bid-unlikely-to-pan-out&quot;&gt;brakes failed while going downhill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;VT Hackney backed out of the partnership and sold their spot in the USPS bid to Workhorse for a small sum&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Workhorse has NEVER showed the capability to manufacture this many vehicles. Oshkosh on the other hand has manufactured thousands of vehicles and accessories for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defensenews.com/land/2020/03/31/oshkosh-wins-contract-to-modernize-armys-heavy-tactical-vehicles/&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/press-release/business-wire/business-government-business-and-finance-government-contracts-north-america-wisconsin-6dfef293a1e74ace8d6d88f5a14ca71f&quot;&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manufacturing.net/supply-chain/news/13067919/army-awards-oshkosh-corp-132m-contract&quot;&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reliableplant.com/Read/25106/Oshkosh-Defense-contracts-Army&quot;&gt;occasions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In 2017, Workhorse&amp;#39;s CEO boasted $300million in preorders for its W-15 pickup truck which sells for $52500. That&amp;#39;s about 5700 trucks. Workhorse&amp;#39;s TOTAL revenue for the subsequent 3 years are: $763K, $376K and $376K. I know Subway franchises that do more sales than that.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the contract does indeed go to Oshkosh/Ford, the likelihood of Microvast being the EV battery supplier is almost certain (see points #2, #3)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. QuantumScape&lt;/strong&gt; $QS is considered by some to be one of Microvast&amp;#39;s main competitors. Their &amp;quot;Solid State Battery&amp;quot; technology is indeed groundbreaking and arguably more advanced than anything in Microvast&amp;#39;s current line up--if it works. According to an article on Seekingalpha, solid state batteries “will only last for 260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving&amp;quot; and are &amp;quot;completely unacceptable for real world field electric vehicles.&amp;quot; There are now lawsuits filed against QS for misleading investors about its battery technology. It&amp;#39;s worth noting that QS peaked at $130+ a share and still trades at $54 today, with a current market cap of about $20 billion. (By contrast, the merger only values Microvast at &lt;strong&gt;$3&lt;/strong&gt; billion!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Not 2027. Not 2025. Now.&lt;/strong&gt; Microvast&amp;#39;s technology is already here and on the roads. Microvast’s batteries are integrated in almost 30,000 vehicles, running in 160 cities in 19 countries. They are generating $100m in annual revenue now, and has signed contracts with value totaling over $1.5 billion. When a major correction comes to wipe the froth off the EV market, Microvast will be just fine because they&amp;#39;re not some story company still putting the finishing touches on their prototype. They have the tech, they have the money, they have the customers. Now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Faster charging times.&lt;/strong&gt; Microvast&amp;#39;s in-production (again, not something coming in 2025) can charge 3 times faster (~22miles/minute) than the current leading passenger BEV (~6miles/minutes). As a Tesla owner, I would say that one of the least enjoyable part of owning a Tesla is waiting for 30-45 minutes at the Super Charge station every three days. I would pay good money for an EV battery which can charge in 1/3 of that time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bonus reason: &lt;strong&gt;11. Changan Automobile,&lt;/strong&gt; one of the big four automakers of China, enters partnership with Microvast to manufacture batteries for their &lt;strong&gt;passenger&lt;/strong&gt; cars. This is important because it makes them a serious contender in the passenger car battery market, which is much bigger than the market for e-bus/truck batteries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bonus reason: &lt;strong&gt;12. MADE IN AMERICA.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;In 2019, at the request of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Microvast began the process of establishing a Li-ion battery facility in the United States.

Revenue has been decreasing if you look at the 5 year annual revenue. I think looking at revenue from 2018 and onwards is more normalized (smartphones start to equal less of total revenue), in which case revenue is trending up from 2018.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not investment advice&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Sukh6&quot;&gt; /u/Sukh6 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljg9bg/blackberry_is_not_a_smartphone_maker_they_offer/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljg9bg/blackberry_is_not_a_smartphone_maker_they_offer/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_ljg9bg</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljg9bg/blackberry_is_not_a_smartphone_maker_they_offer/" /><updated>2021-02-14T03:25:54+00:00</updated><title>Blackberry is not a Smartphone Maker they offer Software Solutions (Revenue Deepdive)</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/stroker351w</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/stroker351w</uri></author><category term="StockMarket" label="r/StockMarket"/><content type="html">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljgas3/dnn/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-QMcnZJcFQjODHfbWZ8RvgV3n_QE46PVVDTNmKOa1O4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;$DNN&quot; title=&quot;$DNN&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/stroker351w&quot;&gt; /u/stroker351w &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/3juexnlv2dh61.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljgas3/dnn/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content><id>t3_ljgas3</id><media:thumbnail url="https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-QMcnZJcFQjODHfbWZ8RvgV3n_QE46PVVDTNmKOa1O4.jpg" /><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljgas3/dnn/" /><updated>2021-02-14T03:28:30+00:00</updated><title>$DNN</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Inside_Maximum7214</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Inside_Maximum7214</uri></author><category term="StockMarket" label="r/StockMarket"/><content type="html">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lja2jl/blackberry_the_power_of_extraordinary_as_your/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/q9cUqORTFBskKqp9juQJybx_BhcitDEn7aWq5iE_WTQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BlackBerry: The Power of Extraordinary.

They focus on glucose monitoring devices. They have developed a new implantable device that a medical professional will put in, then diabetics can use a sensor to track their levels without finger pricks or anything like that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eversensediabetes.com/eversense-cgm-system&quot;&gt;You can read more about it here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, they wanted to bring their new long term monitoring device to market sooner, but due to the pandemic, the FDA reassigned employees from approvals to pandemic related activities. This has pushed approval to 2021, potentially very soon. In the meantime, without FDA approval yet, the company has been racking up some good press, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2021/01/20/senseonics-adds-insurer-initiates-50m-offering.html&quot;&gt;getting approval from insurers to cover their device,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2021/02/01/senseonics-ascensia-cgm-eversense-diabetes-device.html&quot;&gt;closing a stock offering and kicking of European sales,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2021/01/22/senseonics-looking-to-raise-100m-due-to-demand.html&quot;&gt;re-upping their offering due to demand for their tech,&lt;/a&gt; and even announcing that they will &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senseonics-participate-svb-leerink-global-210500537.html&quot;&gt;participate in a global conference about medical tech.&lt;/a&gt; This is all great signals for a device that hasn&amp;#39;t yet hit the market. The company has a history with successful products of this nature, and as of right now, there&amp;#39;s no reason to think that the new product won&amp;#39;t be a smashing success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Except...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The infamous short interest report that WSB is so familiar with. With all the good news, $SENS has already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.equities.com/news/senseonics-holdings-inc-sens-breaks-into-new-52-week-high-on-february-12-session&quot;&gt;posted some serious fucking gains.&lt;/a&gt; Is the new high a sign of a bear around the corner? I don&amp;#39;t think so, as the good news keeps coming. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5278808/&quot;&gt;This report from the National Library of Medicine, and the National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt; projects that the number of of Americans with type 1 or 2 diabetes will increase to about 55 million people by 2030. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5278808/&quot;&gt;And this report from the CDC&lt;/a&gt; says that in 2020, 34 million people have diabetes, and 88 million have &amp;quot;pre-diabetes&amp;quot; in the US alone. But all that does not seem to impress institutional investors, because they have been absolutely loading up short positions against $SENS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSEAMERICAN/SENS/short-interest/&quot;&gt;The Jan 29 short interest report&lt;/a&gt; shows that over the last two reporting periods, short positions have increased 20%, and now represent 46.6% of the float shorted, moving up from an average of 24 million shares to now about 54 million. I&amp;#39;m not 100% sure why that coincides with the recent stock offerings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That being said,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While waiting for approval for the new device, Senseonics has also asked the FDA to approve their new device for 180 days instead of 90. Also, there is an earnings report that should come out around March 11. While they have missed earnings estimates for the last few reports, it is likely that is due to a drop off in demand for their old product, and investment in the new device. This is a company that offers a unique product that has over 400 million potential worldwide customers. The tech is easy to use, and even syncs with your phone automatically in scheduled intervals. The company has had a negative pe ratio for pretty much ever. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think there is still some serious upside to this stock, and bought 1,000 shares at $3.54. This is a hugely speculative play and my opinion should never ever be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Whiskeymill&quot;&gt; /u/Whiskeymill &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljju44/senseonics_sens_dd/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljju44/senseonics_sens_dd/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_ljju44</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljju44/senseonics_sens_dd/" /><updated>2021-02-14T07:19:04+00:00</updated><title>Senseonics $SENS DD</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Inside_Maximum7214</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Inside_Maximum7214</uri></author><category term="StockMarket" label="r/StockMarket"/><content type="html">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lj3jb9/mark_wilson_has_been_pivoting_blackberry_from/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VhrDoC23ory6gfb5o3ab_dYluhZxwfKnjUgySsi2tKU.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;...Mark Wilson has been pivoting BlackBerry from being a smartphone manufacturer to a company focused on cybersecurity, AI and the Internet of Things.&amp;quot; Congrats to BlackBerry CMO, Mark Wilson, for being recognized on #ForbesCMONext! cc: @martyswant&quot; title=&quot;&amp;quot;...Mark Wilson has been pivoting BlackBerry from being a smartphone manufacturer to a company focused on cybersecurity, AI and the Internet of Things.&amp;quot; Congrats to BlackBerry CMO, Mark Wilson, for being recognized on #ForbesCMONext! cc: @martyswant&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Inside_Maximum7214&quot;&gt; /u/Inside_Maximum7214 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/du26ovd2c3h61.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lj3jb9/mark_wilson_has_been_pivoting_blackberry_from/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content><id>t3_lj3jb9</id><media:thumbnail url="https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VhrDoC23ory6gfb5o3ab_dYluhZxwfKnjUgySsi2tKU.jpg" /><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lj3jb9/mark_wilson_has_been_pivoting_blackberry_from/" /><updated>2021-02-13T16:20:41+00:00</updated><title>&quot;...Mark Wilson has been pivoting BlackBerry from being a smartphone manufacturer to a company focused on cybersecurity, AI and the Internet of Things.&quot; Congrats to BlackBerry CMO, Mark Wilson, for being recognized on #ForbesCMONext! cc: @martyswant</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/greenappletree</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/greenappletree</uri></author><category term="StockMarket" label="r/StockMarket"/><content type="html">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljbufo/what_happens_when_you_invest_your_starbucks/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oiZJZwNa1aSYVinRQwZoGc6q7vnJKjXk1WJVmqn4yrc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;What happens when you invest your Starbucks coffee money instead?

I currently have a loan through my bank, that I ONLY make interest payments on and do not need to make principal payments until I graduate. If I were to pull the $8000 out, I would pay roughly $36 a month to have this money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do I take the $8000 and let it sit in the S &amp;amp; P 500? It’s currently the only ETF/Stock that I am comfortable with the risks/reward benefit. It is currently averaging approx. 17% ROI and I will make $1360 profit in the first year while only paying out $432 in interest, netting me a $928 profit. Is this to good to be true???&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have a full time job lined up for the summer where I will make $25-$30/hr, and I’m faithful that I will land a job within my 6 months of graduation as a welding inspector working shutdowns clearing $10k a month. I’m not worried about losing this $8000. I’m simply just wanting to play with it because I have it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will graduate with payments starting in June and will owe $240/mth for 3 years if I take this money out and don’t pay it off after I land a good inspection job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Thiccc_Toast&quot;&gt; /u/Thiccc_Toast &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljktxx/investing_100_of_my_student_loan_into_sp/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljktxx/investing_100_of_my_student_loan_into_sp/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_ljktxx</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljktxx/investing_100_of_my_student_loan_into_sp/" /><updated>2021-02-14T08:39:58+00:00</updated><title>Investing 100% of my student loan into s&amp;p</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Spursreporter</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Spursreporter</uri></author><category term="StockMarket" label="r/StockMarket"/><content type="html">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljkjw4/technical_analysis_on_the_most_traded_stock_in/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0kVgvisgeRlKFQHeyd_TRhmVVHAK7N8iF224q6NfcaY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Technical analysis on the most traded stock in the market for over a week: $SNDL&quot; title=&quot;Technical analysis on the most traded stock in the market for over a week: $SNDL&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Spursreporter&quot;&gt; /u/Spursreporter &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iqstockalerts1/status/1360856040716210177?s=21&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljkjw4/technical_analysis_on_the_most_traded_stock_in/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content><id>t3_ljkjw4</id><media:thumbnail url="https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0kVgvisgeRlKFQHeyd_TRhmVVHAK7N8iF224q6NfcaY.jpg" /><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljkjw4/technical_analysis_on_the_most_traded_stock_in/" /><updated>2021-02-14T08:15:15+00:00</updated><title>Technical analysis on the most traded stock in the market for over a week: $SNDL</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/JacobJoke123</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/JacobJoke123</uri></author><category term="StockMarket" label="r/StockMarket"/><content type="html">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljkasi/hold/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/2a4lv3qak_w73WaNgWJLsocT_Elk0CaU2tMI9s3yI98.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hold&quot; title=&quot;Hold&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/JacobJoke123&quot;&gt; /u/JacobJoke123 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/7jytq7nufeh61.jpg&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljkasi/hold/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content><id>t3_ljkasi</id><media:thumbnail url="https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/2a4lv3qak_w73WaNgWJLsocT_Elk0CaU2tMI9s3yI98.jpg" /><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljkasi/hold/" /><updated>2021-02-14T07:54:57+00:00</updated><title>Hold</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/AwwHellsNo</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/AwwHellsNo</uri></author><category term="StockMarket" label="r/StockMarket"/><content type="html">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ljhfw7/uk_hit_with_biggest_economic_decline_in_more_than/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Pf4GDoGTf_3UJIPLu745DAmMOGjiDxPycD1R2jtQ4BQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;U.K. hit with biggest economic decline in more than 300 years&amp;quot; ...

It’s going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is less pushback to President Biden’s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,” noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has also increased concerns about inflation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Inflation and rising yields&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past week, the 10-year yield — a key benchmark — touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you think about the big drivers, they’re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. “If there’s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Because there’s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we’ll see if that has eased,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Obviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,” said Krosby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Housing statistics&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes Stocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&amp;amp;P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robinhood’s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market’s advance is intact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Overall, it’s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,” Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there’s cyclical leadership.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,” said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/L9zmpOB.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Indices for this past week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cZgpsNC.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Futures Markets as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BvmjknF.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wWv2RIG.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AfQYO3V.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GNiq0fE.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/v4lTpw4.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/83YL2qB.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the upcoming IPO&amp;#39;s for this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0AZF7RF.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&amp;#39;s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp;amp; Downgrades:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MUQx3xY.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/60KQa22.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LBj1NDa.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Presidents&amp;#39; Day Seasonality&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents&amp;#39; Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington&amp;#39;s birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents&amp;#39; Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President&amp;#39;s Day through the Friday after, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents&amp;#39; week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&amp;amp;P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week&amp;#39;s end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&amp;amp;P 500 during Presidents&amp;#39; Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&amp;amp;P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&amp;amp;P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&amp;amp;P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Trading After Presidents’ Day Weekend Continues to be Weak&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&amp;amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of –0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of –0.49% and a median loss of –0.11%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of –0.07% and a median decline of –0.10%. S&amp;amp;P 500 is down 18 of 31, average –0.02%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average –0.01%, median –0.09%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs—it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn’t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here’s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Short Interest Update&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile&amp;#39;s stock&amp;#39;s median change in short interest from then to yesterday&amp;#39;s release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000&amp;#39;s most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard&amp;#39;s (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, which now has over 30% of shares short, has risen 91.01%. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard&amp;#39;s (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker&amp;#39;s dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three—nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)—now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020.

The broker Trading212 gives the option to invest in a &amp;#39;Pie&amp;#39;. The pie can consist of up to 100 stocks and you may even use auto-investing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now there is a guy who has made a copy of the ARKK innovative ETF. Which is great, since in the Netherlands you cannot buy ARKK because they do not have an Essential document in the Dutch language. So this is an alternative manner to invest in the same stock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing that is bothering me is that the pie consists of 50 stocks. I know that trading212 has &amp;#39;hidden costs&amp;#39; through the creation of higher spread. If I buy 50 stocks a month through them, will I not lose a substantial amount of money to the broker?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any advice here?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gr.
